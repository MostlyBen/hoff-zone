## Info

> Hey, Hoff made this website for you

- [ ] It has checkboxes like this you can check off

You can type a command like `sci 11` on the left to go to our first module.

You can also type `journal` to turn it into a space for you to take notes while you're working.

(All this stuff is only saved on your device)

## Sci 11 // Effects of Radiation
[`sci 11`](/sci/11) // *September*

This module is about scientific communication and why it's so easy for misinformation to spread. We will do some science-learning, discuss how easy it is to learn the wrong thing, and use that to fight against existing misinformation. Teaming up with Computer Apps, you will learn fundamentals of digital and graphic design to create an Ad Campaign fighting misinformation.

## Sci 12 // Nuclear Chemistry
[`sci 12`](/sci/12) // *October*

Wow, another Computer Apps module?!! Yup, this time we're using our computers to visualize things that we normally can't see. Namely, the 5 nuclear processes: Alpha Decay, Beta Decay, Gamma Decay, Fusion, and Fission. Don't worry, you'll learn what those are. Then, we'll work with Mr. Lawton-Zandstra and our community partners over at CasualOS to make simulations of the processes.

## Sci 13 // Radiation Technology
[`sci 13`](/sci/13) // *November*

Yeah, radiation can be bad. It's usually not, though. Now that we have a better understanding of what radiation is and where it comes from, we will explore some of the ways we use it in modern society. You'll pick your favorite, make a model of it, and teach us all about it.
