standards:
  - HS-PS1-8 Develop models to illustrate the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom and the energy released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay.
  - HS-PS4-3 Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.
driving-question: What is radiation?
know:
  - Describe how the nucleus changes during radioactive decay, fission, and fusion.
  - Explain at a grandmotherly level how light/radiation is both a wave and a particle.
understand: '"Nobody really understands quantum mechanics." Richard Feynman'
do: |-
  Create an infographic that includes original models that represent the changes in matter and energy during each of the 5 nuclear processes.
  The infographic must include an explanation of why the gamma ray is a wave and a particle.
