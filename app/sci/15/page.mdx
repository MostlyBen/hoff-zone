## The Boss Fight
When your episode doc is done, you will have an intellectual battle with Mr. Hoff.

He will ask you questions about topics from the episode doc until you can't answer any more.

If you can't answer questions about each episode, he will send you back with a study guide before you try again.

When you're done, you may start working on your project.
