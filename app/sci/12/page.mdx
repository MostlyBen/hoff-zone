  - module
standards:
  - HS-PS1-8 Develop models to illustrate the changes in the composition of the nucleus of the atom and the energy released during the processes of fission, fusion, and radioactive decay.
  - HS-PS4-3 Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning behind the idea that electromagnetic radiation can be described either by a wave model or a particle model, and that for some situations one model is more useful than the other.
driving-question: What is radiation?
know:
  - Describe how the nucleus changes during radioactive decay, fission, and fusion.
  - Explain at a grandmotherly level how light/radiation is both a wave and a particle.
understand: '"Nobody really understands quantum mechanics." Richard Feynman'
do: |-
  Create an simulation that includes original models that represent the changes in matter and energy during each of the 5 nuclear processes.

## The Project
[Link to Design Brief](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ESp9Jnvof_gJsBhvlcRI8A4a6EncWgSZ4-KgKviwbPY/edit?usp=sharing)

> As a group (up to 3 students), you will be creating simulations of all 5 Nuclear Processes on [https://ab1.bot](https://ab1.bot)
> 
> ‎
> 
> Having trouble learning ab1.bot?
> 
> Play through the [tutorial Mr. Hoff made](https://ab1.bot/?ab=tutorial)

### FRAME | Group Roles
- [ ] If you're working **in a group**, decide how you'll **split up the work**.
<table>
<thead><tr>
	<th>By Process</th>						<th>By Job</th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
	<tr><td>Alpha/Beta Decay</td>	<td>Animator</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Gamma Decay</td>			<td>UX Designer/Developer</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Fusion/Fission</td>		<td>Science Expert & Stylizer</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### FIND | Existning Models
- [ ] **Find inspiration** for your Project
- [ ] Collect at least 3 good and 3 bad models
- [ ] Share with your group what you think makes them good and bad

> PSSST, here are some links to models of random stuff:
> 
> [Science Illustrations (preview)](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2022/10/science-illustration-book/)
> 
> [2046 Print Shop](https://2046printshop.com/collections/screen-print?sort_by=created-descending)
> 
> [Classic 90's Physics Models](https://www.physics.mun.ca/~jjerrett/animations.html)

### PLAY/PLAN | Make Something Interactive
> It's time to start **making atoms** in [ab1.bot](https://ab1.bot)
- [ ] Make an nucleus (including Protons & Neutrons) in ab1.bot
- [ ] Find a way to make the the simulation interactive

### MAKE | Simulation Suite
- [ ] Decide how your group will **stylize** your simulations
	- Including atoms, buttons, and anything else in the sim
- [ ] **Collect** all 5 simulations into a **single experience** on ab1.bot

### SHARE | Get Feedback
- [ ] Show your simulation to someone from a different grade
- [ ] Get their feedback
- [ ] If their feedback wasn't helpful, get more
- [ ] Update your simulation
