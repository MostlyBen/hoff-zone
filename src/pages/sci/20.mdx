There will be info about the project here, I promise.

Like, episode doc links or something.

- This would be a list item
- [ ] This would be a checklist item
1. This would be a numbered item

[HS-PS2-5](https://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/default/files/HS-PS2-5_Evidence%20Statements%20Jan%202015.pdf) Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that an electric current can produce a magnetic field and that a changing magnetic field can produce an electric current.

[HS-PS3-3](https://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/default/files/evidence_statement/black_white/HS-PS3-3%20Evidence%20Statements%20June%202015%20asterisks.pdf) Design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy.

[HS-PS3-1](https://www.nextgenscience.org/sites/default/files/evidence_statement/black_white/HS-PS3-1%20Evidence%20Statements%20June%202015%20asterisks.pdf) Create a computational model to calculate the change in the energy of one component in a system when the change in energy of the other component(s) and energy flows in and out of the system are known.
