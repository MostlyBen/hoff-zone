standards:
  - HS-PS4-4 Evaluate the validity and reliability of claims in published materials of the effects that different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter
  - HS-PS4-1 Use mathematical representations to support a claim regarding relationships among the frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media.
competencies:
  - Interpreting Information
  - Building Empathy
driving-question: Is your cell phone secretly killing you?
know:
  - The energy of a photon depends on its wavelength
  - Ionizing radiation is radiation without enough energy to knock an electron off of an atom
understand: Radiation is good, bad, and beautiful
do: "Make a video that evaluates the strength of arguments on both sides of the question: does 5G cause cancer?"

## Introduction
> For this project, we will be learning about radiation and misinformation. We're starting with some "research"

[Go to these slides for instructions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19cb9F6-AOEohMfFa1Eyy8lbcFUuqz6uDC-F3jWMyGpc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Episode Doc
### Episode 1 | Frequency Vs Wavelength
- [ ] Pick at least one of the following:
	= [ ] **ATTEND** a workshop where Mr. Hoff explains this episode
	- [ ] **READ** [CK-12 chapter](https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.8/primary/lesson/wave-speed-ms-ps/) *// if examples help you understand*
	- [ ] **READ** [HyperPhysics Article](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wavrel.html) *// if math helps you understand*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [Using the Wave Equation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-wSHmXB64o?rel=0) *// If videos are more your speed*
- [ ] [Play around with this simulation](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Waves-and-Sound/Simple-Wave-Simulator/Simple-Wave-Simulator-Interactive) to make sure you understand how Frequency, Wavelength, and Speed are related

### Episode 2 | Ionizing Vs Non-Ionizing
- [ ] Pick at least one of the following:
	- [ ] **READ** [Radiation Basics](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics) *// An article from the EPA that explains Ionizing Radiation well*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [SciShow: Radiation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJ3ea9fa6CA?rel=0) *// Omg, it's the crash course guy!*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [In-Depth Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_RcytVWBrg?rel=0) *// This guy really knows what he's talking about*
- [ ] **WATCH** [This TED-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI2vRwFKnHQ?rel=0) about the types of radiation *// It's short and worth it. Trust*

### Episode 3 | Cancer
- [ ] **READ** [this scientific report](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/cellphones/index.html) about the risks of cell phone radiation

### Want to Work in a Group?
If you'd like to work in a group, Mr. Hoff has a process for creating a group & pitching your idea to him.

(It's experimental, so please give your feedback on it)

Just let Mr. Hoff know and follow [these steps](https://publish.obsidian.md/hoff/public/teaching+stuff/team+project+launch) to plan out your project.

## The Project^editable
[Link to Design Brief](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19baf12yfsFk6aODSSCLgHiMcCOaHENuY/view?usp=sharing)
> Google's research team, "Jigsaw," has a really interesting report on conspiracy theories and the internet
> 
> You don't *have* to read it, but it's really good
> 
> [Click here to read](https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/conspiracy-theories/)

### Your Goal
1. Become an expert in a conspiracy theory
2. Come up with a plan to fight it
3. Execute your plan
### 📋 Conspiracy Theory Report
- [ ] Choose a conspiracy theory to study
- [ ] Collect research about it
- [ ] Fill out the [Conspiracy Theory Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16UUjz7EQJ5pEFzEAcEj_fFgSfgfELMcyoQVJxBdF5HM/edit#heading=h.28w6alb1jx9m), summarizing your research
- [ ] When you feel like an expert, present your report to Mr. Hoff for approval to move on

### 💪 Counter-Misinformation Project
#### 💡 Figure out how conspiracy theories can be fought
- [ ] **READ** [This Scientific American article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-you-fight-conspiracy-theories/#)
#### 🤔 Now, come up with a plan
- [ ] [Check out this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bkOTKbIqywsw8NGIns8zqpBPnOD9JUyH9BgCHToVjsg/edit?usp=sharing) for a way you could structure your plan
- [ ] Plan out how you will fight the conspiracy theory
- [ ] Get approval from Mr. Hoff to move on
#### 🏃 Make your thing
- [ ] Follow the plan that you made
- [ ] Show off what you did on the [Showcase Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqD-6A4lYz_oTfxvcyu3NKQvQ77WBWBwg4jKzIbgrt4/edit?usp=sharing)
