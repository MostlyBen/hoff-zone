standards:
  - HS-PS4-4 Evaluate the validity and reliability of claims in published materials of the effects that different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have when absorbed by matter
  - HS-PS4-1 Use mathematical representations to support a claim regarding relationships among the frequency, wavelength, and speed of waves traveling in various media.
driving-question: Is your cell phone secretly killing you?
know:
  - The energy of a photon depends on its wavelength
  - Ionizing radiation is radiation without enough energy to knock an electron off of an atom
understand: Radiation is good, bad, and beautiful
do: "Make a video that evaluates the strength of arguments on both sides of the question: does 5G cause cancer?"

## Episode Doc
### Episode 1 | Frequency Vs Wavelength
- [ ] Pick at least one of the following:
	- [ ] **READ** [CK-12 chapter](https://flexbooks.ck12.org/cbook/ck-12-middle-school-physical-science-flexbook-2.0/section/16.8/primary/lesson/wave-speed-ms-ps/) *// if examples help you understand*
	- [ ] **READ** [HyperPhysics Article](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/wavrel.html) *// if math helps you understand*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [Using the Wave Equation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-wSHmXB64o?rel=0) *// If videos are more your speed*
- [ ] [Play around with this simulation](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/Physics-Interactives/Waves-and-Sound/Simple-Wave-Simulator/Simple-Wave-Simulator-Interactive) to make sure you understand how Frequency, Wavelength, and Speed are related

### Episode 2 | Ionizing Vs Non-Ionizing
- [ ] Pick at least one of the following:
	- [ ] **READ** [Radiation Basics](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics) *// An article from the EPA that explains Ionizing Radiation well*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [SciShow: Radiation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJ3ea9fa6CA?rel=0) *// Omg, it's the crash course guy!*
	- [ ] **WATCH** [In-Depth Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_RcytVWBrg?rel=0) *// This guy really knows what he's talking about*
- [ ] **WATCH** [This TED-Ed video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/zI2vRwFKnHQ?rel=0) about the types of radiation *// It's short and worth it. Trust*

### Episode 3 | Cancer
- [ ] **READ** [this scientific report](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/cellphones/index.html) about the risks of cell phone radiation
